Server runs on port 8787 by default.

We are using: Tornado, Curtain, httplib2, urllib, and Tkinter.
Python version should be 2.7+

The server looks for the user directory and .passwd file in the same directory as it is run.

The client program assumes that the Upload and Download directories are the same, and are the folder in which it is run.
